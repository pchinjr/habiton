# fresh project

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

# Using Codespaces
There's a .devcontainer folder with the configuration of the container the codespace uses. I have configued it to include the latest deno binary, and two vscode extensions.
